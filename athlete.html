    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>
        Milkha Singh started his international career from the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. He represented India in the 200m
        and 400m category. Although he could not get past the heat stages, meeting champion Charles Jenkins at the games
        inspired him greatly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1958, he won 2 gold medals in the 200m and 400m events at the Asian Games. He then won a gold medal in
            the 400m competition at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games, which were held the same year, with a
            time of 46.6 seconds. This made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games from independent
            India.</li>

        <li>In 1960, after his successful race against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, a post-race comment by General Ayub
            Khan led him to acquire the title of <i><b>The Flying Sikh.</i></b></li>

        <li>In the 1960 olympics, running at the 400m event, he was leading till the 200m mark but he slowed down and
            ended up finishing fourth. He finished the race with a timing of 45.73 seconds, setting a National Record
            that stood for 40 years.</li>
        <li>In the 1962 Asian Games, Milkha Singh won 2 gold medals, one in 400m and the other in 4 x 100m relay.</li>

    <h1> Later Life</h1>
    <p>
        Following his achievement in 1958, Singh received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honor. He
        declined an offer of the Arjuna Award from the Indian government in 2001, saying that it was meant to honor
        youthful athletes rather than people like him.
        He also believed that it was wrong to offer the Award to those who had little to no prominent engagement in
        competitive sports. He said that the award had lost its meaning and that <i> "I have been clubbed with athletes
            who
            are nowhere near the level that I had achieved."</i>
        In 2014, he described his experience in a college in Goa by saying, <i> "Awards today are given out like
            'prasad' in
            a shrine. Why should someone be honored if they haven't met the criteria for the award? After receiving the
            Padma Shri, I turned down the Arjuna that was presented to me.
            It was comparable to receiving an SSC certificate after earning a master's degree."</i> <br>

    <h1>Personal Life</h1>
    <p>
        Singh resided in Chandigarh as of 2012. In Ceylon in 1955, he fell in love with <b>Nirmal Saini, a former
            captain
            of the Indian women's volleyball team.</b> The two were wed in 1962 and had three daughters in addition to a
        son,
        golfer Jeev Milkha Singh.
        They adopted Havildar Bikram Singh's seven-year-old son in 1999 after he lost his life in the Battle of Tiger
        Hill. <br>
